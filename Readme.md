# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
    

## MY TASK
    My task was to take an existing code and refactor it by improving 
    the code without changing the end result. 
    I did this my adding semantic HTML elements, 
    making the website more accessible through alt tags, using a logical structure to group the different sections though out, 
    and over all clean ups to create a more concise code.

## User Story

    AS A marketing agency
    I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
    SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## MOCK UP
